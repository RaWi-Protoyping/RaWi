B.Sc.,2,3,Yes,PowerPoint and Photoshop,4,4,4,4,4,1,4,1,4,2,5,1,4,1,Easy to use and user friendly,-,"Currently it would be sufficient, but with new requirements more ideas would pop up (like adding own templates)"
B.Sc.,2,3,Yes,PowerPoint,4,4,4,5,4,1,4,3,4,2,4,2,3,2,Simpleness,Some standard features were not included like ctrl-c,
B.Sc.,2,3,Yes,Moqups,4,3,4,5,3,1,5,1,2,2,5,2,4,1,Search bar for similar prototypes,The GUI,Nicer look and feel of the prototyping software
B.Sc.,2,4,Yes,"Balsamiq, Power Point",3,3,5,4,3,1,5,1,4,2,4,2,4,1,many examples mockups which made it easy to integrate several icons; very easy to use,"some functions are missing like coloring the background of a label, different fonts (like they where in the first Mockup Tool)","adding functions like different fonts, background coloring, adding own images or icons"
M.Sc.,2,3,No,,2,3,2,3,2,1,5,1,2,4,5,3,4,2,Very Easy To Use,"Many functionalities were missing, not very in-depth","Incorporate more functionalities from the MockupClassic tool (e.g. Change size more easily, more components to add, ...)"
PhD,4,5,No,,4,5,4,5,4,2,4,2,3,2,4,3,4,1,"Quick and fitting search results, which supported the design of the use case which I had to design","There could be more convenience features like multi-selection, resizing and so on",As I said I would like to have more convenience features or to be able to modify copied UI-Components further for example
M.Sc.,1,5,No,,4,3,4,4,4,1,5,1,4,1,5,1,4,1,it is simple to use and enables me to reuse existing screens and edit them as needed,nothing as i do not miss anything for the tasks to solve in the study,-
PhD,1,4,No,,3,4,4,4,5,1,5,1,4,1,5,1,4,1,"Clean UI, Auto-Correct",Missing customizability functions after selecting a base GUI template,
B.Sc.,4,1,No,,4,4,5,4,3,1,4,1,4,1,4,1,4,1,"Easy to use, easy search, no previous knowledge necessary, nice and relevant templates","No keyboard shortcuts like copy or paste, no adjustment for the forms and buttons, no support of selecting multiple objects","keyboard shortcuts like copy or paste, adjustment for the forms and buttons, support of selecting multiple objects, zoom"
M.Sc.,1,4,No,,5,4,5,5,4,1,5,1,4,2,5,1,5,1,Helped with GUI-suggestions and was easy to use.,,
M.Sc.,2,3,Yes,Powerpoint,4,4,4,5,5,1,5,1,4,1,5,1,4,1,"I like that you can search with terms or sentences that might be relevant for your prototype and then get inspiration from the screens that are displayed as a search result for your own GUI. In addition, it is very nice that you can simply drag and drop components from existing GUIs to anywhere where you need them.",It would be nice if buttons and images could be resized. Another minor function that might be quite helpful is a revert function that is able to revert recent actions.,
M.Sc.,3,2,Yes,Balsamiq Mockups,2,3,4,5,2,1,5,1,4,4,5,2,2,1,The Visualization of finished GUIs and the ability to reuse other GUIs,GUI elements are sometimes not compatible with each other and there are not enough options to modify them.,Allow the import of own images and icons
PhD,3,4,Yes,"Adobe XD, XCode, Powerpoint",3,3,3,5,4,1,3,1,4,2,5,3,4,2,Seeing real GUIs for inspiration and being able to edit them on the fly. I also liked the partition of the screen into Source/Workspace/Result which corresponds to my workflow. The tool is very easy and intuitive to use.,"There's no unified design for the GUIs, which makes everything look a bit random. And there's no undo button ;)",More simple components in addition to the real GUIs - then you don't have to find every small icon somewhere in an app.
M.Sc.,3,5,Yes,"Powerpoint, Draw.io, Photoshop",5,4,5,5,5,1,4,1,4,1,5,2,3,2,"I like the search functionality, that enables you to find many relevant examples for different domains and the ability to reuse UI components that are found of different screens simply by using drag-and-drop. Also the option to right-click in the Create Wireframe browser and select different commands, e.g. delete gui, transition or UI component or 'Create New' is very handy. Especially, the command 'Create New' is very useful, because it allows the user to quickly create a new type of component from a list of frequently used components.","Some of the functionalities could be made more usable. For instance, the option to copy a UI component can be made to work with Keyboard controls instead of simply using right click and selecting the copy command. Also the selection of multiple UI Components from a given screen should be made possible, as well as moving the selection between screens.",Enable more keyboard shortcuts for the existing commands like copy (also see prev. answer).
PhD,2,4,Yes,Powerpoint,4,3,4,4,4,2,4,1,4,3,4,1,4,1,Amount of Templates and Drag and Drop,Copy of own text lables did not work directly,Auto suggestions for relevant/additional search terms to find a template more quickly
M.Sc.,2,3,Yes,"Android Studio, Powerpoint, javafx",4,3,5,5,4,2,4,1,4,3,5,2,5,1,"very easy to use, good to get first result very fast",no resizing of objectives,"Resizing, strg c strg v, lines that help to arange different objectives"
B.Sc.,4,3,Yes,"Powerpoint, SharePoint",4,5,5,5,4,2,4,2,4,3,5,2,4,1,"Many template to choose from; Search query works well,","Unable to adjust the size, font etc. If we edit the original text, we lost the original fonts. Unable to upload custom image. ","Edit Mode to adjust the size, font, color etc... The selection of UI components, e.g. batch selection and unselect if we click on the background or somewhere else, because it is easy to create a link between two GUI by mistake."
M.Sc.,3,4,Yes,Adobe XD,4,4,5,4,3,2,4,1,4,1,5,2,4,1,Quick progress because of inspirations,Some GUIs were not able to use,
B.Sc.,3,4,Yes,"Adobe Indesign, Powerpoint, Gimp",4,3,4,4,3,1,4,2,3,3,4,2,3,1,Allows very quick building of guis. Presets give an inspiration,Usability could be better sometimes. Presets can distract from what I want to build.,Selecting and moving multiple components. Resizing images. Maybe extract elements from found guis and let the user use them individually without having to extract them from the gui manually.
