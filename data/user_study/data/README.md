# User Study Overview

This directory contains all the datasets from our the extensive user evaluation of our rapid prototyping approach. The structure is as follows:

- **raw**: Contains the raw dataset collected during the user study which formed the input to our post-experiment analysis. In particular, for each user study participant it contains five screenshots taken for each of the four GUIs prototyped during the study.
- **processed**: Contains the different #GUI-comp count metric datasets obtained by analysing the raw screenshot data from the participants. In particular, it contains the basic #GUI-comp count (#gui_comps.csv), the #GUI-comp-div count taking into account the content diversity (#gui_comps_div.csv) and the #GUI-comp-neg count considering the number of GUI components in the prototypes that were not requested (#gui_comps_neg.csv).
- **survey**: Contains the  dataset obtained from the survey (survey.csv)
