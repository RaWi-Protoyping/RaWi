[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/465262035.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/465262035)

The supplementary material of our submission to the ASE Journal is structured as follows:

- **data**: This directory contains all the datasets used for GUI ranking and all the materials and datasets from the conducted user study
- **gui2r**: This directory contains the overall Python-based implementation of the retrieval models and architecture from our paper
- **notebooks**: This directory contains several Jupyter Notebooks for (1) the creation of the GUI retrieval gold standard, (2) the style property extraction of GUI components, (3) the analysis of the user study and (4) the per-query analysis of the AQE evaluation results
- **webapp**: This directoy contains the prototypical implementation of our approach based on a Django web application
