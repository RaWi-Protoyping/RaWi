The Rico GUIs can be downloaded from the following website: https://interactionmining.org/rico. The two datasets *"UI Screenshots and View Hierarchies"* and *"UI Screenshots and Hierarchies with Semantic Annotations"* need to be unpacked with their folders into this directory. The two CSV files *"UI Metadata"* and *"Play Store Metadata"* need to be provided in this directory as well.
